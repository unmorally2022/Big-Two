Capsa Susun, yes, this is code that i made to make Capsa Susun application and it's very similiar with Big Two, 
but it is not perfect yet. By having lack of checking the score of each cards obtained by each players,
also the robot which are playing with opponent didn't not have a state machine, only arranging cards based on the largest score. 
Also the control is still using mouse, not touch screen like on a mobile, but it just needs a little improvement for that case. 
While making this code I used a lot of references from many resource that i found on the internet to make it easier and shorten the developing time. 
Likewise for the assets that I use is the assets that are provided free to use, because I do not have ability to create assets or create images.

History :
I made this code with the aim of doing unity test programmer at touchten games on 2022 april 09, through a notification 
from a geek hunter which started by telling me to learn more about 3D programming using unity. 
So after that i was learn the very basic things about 3D programming using unity from youtube.
Only to move 3D object, basic collider, camera positioning to make 3rd person view. 
After that the test is not emphasizes with unity 3D programming, as you can see in the critria above.
And i think it's more to the algorithm that used to check the card score, and algorithm to arrange the cards to get best value for the robot.

Here are the criteria that i mean before

Assessment Criteria:
• Use of pooling for spawned objects.
• Finite State Machine to control player state (e.g. start, running, die) and game state (e.g. ready, game run, game end).
• Demonstrates usage of common Design Pattern (singleton, factory, observer,
etc.).
• Basic AI design.
• Collision / colliders if necessary.
• C# Event and Delegate usage inside the game. Or even better, show usage of UniRX / Reactive programming.
• Correct usage of coroutine.
• Dependency Injection / Entity Component System implementation.
• Usage of UI framework (Unity UI or other framework is OK).
• Git as source control.
• Assets and performance optimization.

to finish this test they gave me 7 days, 
but when i contacted touchten, they will give me more time if i haven't finished the code.
unfortuneately until now 2022 july 01 there is no news if they accept me as their employee or not from touchten or even from geekhunter, 
when i contact geekhunter, he only said to keep follow up and still same, no news
